# Fight-or-Flee
This is a small text-based game I created during my high school computer science class. As of now, I have an unresolved MaximumRecursion error when the enemy's attack is less than or equal to the player's defense. When time comes, I will look into it.

The game, in its current state, is a text-based game. This was the first computing project I have ever done and have spent around 1 month of total work time. Please enjoy.
